# Ruby Linked List

A simple implementation of a singly linked list in Ruby. This project demonstrates the basic operations on a linked list, such as appending, prepending, inserting, removing, searching, and traversing the list.

## Overview

This project includes two main classes:

- **Node**: Represents each element in the list, holding a value and a pointer to the next node.
- **LinkedList**: Manages the nodes and provides methods to manipulate the list.

The project also contains a test script that demonstrates how to use the linked list.

## Features

- **Append**: Add an element to the end of the list.
- **Prepend**: Add an element to the beginning of the list.
- **Access by Index**: Retrieve the value stored at a specific index.
- **Pop**: Remove the last element from the list.
- **Find**: Return the index of a node with a given value.
- **Insert At**: Insert a new element at a specified index.
- **Remove At**: Remove an element from a specified index.
- **Contains?**: Check if the list contains a given value.
- **String Representation**: Visualize the list using the `to_s` method.

## Getting Started
